          <p>
            "The Founder of this institution rose from a humble beginning to
            shine like a luminous star. He succeeded in his mission through his
            relentless hard work. Sri. V.J.K. Dass was born on 20th November
            1921. He did his M.A. in Mysore University. . He got the idea to
            start up his own tutorial and succeeded in establishing it with a
            good strength, which continued for 10 years. He started a small
            primary school at Alwarpet and many celebrities studied in this
            school. The school was then shifted adjacent to Stella Maris College
            and had a strength of 3000 children from LKG to 12th Std. This is
            the first CBSE school in Chennai. The school was later shifted to
            Adyar. Today the school bears testimony to what an individual can
            achieve and contribute to the society as his legacy. In order to
            give him a tribute for his hardwork.Founders day is celebrited every
            single year."
